### Things to Come
Dear fellow reviewers, 

The game you see here is not yet what we would like to implement as a finished project. 
We would like to create a game for children that would make the snake "say" the colour of 
the food object it would like to eat. In doing so, we would like to create two or more food 
objects of different colours at the same time, only one of which would be the correct colour. 
Since the whole group's programming experience is rather limited, we strive more towards 
functionality rather than visual design, which is why we probably will not be adding much more 
to it in that regard. However, we hope you will still enjoy the game and let us know in what 
ways we could improve and possibly what you already like about it :)
