### Things to Come
Dear fellow reviewers, 

The game you see here is not yet what we would like to implement as a finished project. 
We intend to create a game for children that would make the snake "say" the colour of 
the food object it would like to eat. In doing so and to add a level of difficulty, two or more food 
objects of different colours should appear at the same time, only one of which would be the correct colour. 
Since the whole group's programming experience is rather limited, we strive more towards 
functionality rather than visual design, which is why we probably will not be adding much more 
to it in that regard. That being said, one bug that we intend to fix over the course of the next weeks is that 
the food should not appear on top of the snake. We hope you will enjoy this nostalgic game and let us know 
in what ways we could improve and possibly what you already like about it :)
